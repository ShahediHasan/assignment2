            <p>Hello World! Our mission is live a simple life not buying a camera. It is really difficult to run our life in this modern era. We are not satisfied. We are not able to fulfill our demand. Actually, we do not know exactly our demand. We think that if we get something we will become happy. However, we want another one when we get first one. Life never be happy until we die. Finally, we should keep our mind happy whatever we have with us and the most important one is good health.</p>
